    - $10 for ASA members but not SSC members
    - $25 for non-ASA members (... or, even better, [join ASA](https://www.amstat.org/membership/become-a-member) as a student for only $25, select SSC as one of your free sections, then register for the conference for free and enjoy a year of membership benefits!)
- Non-students:
    - $10 for SSC members
    - $25 for ASA members but not SSC members
    - $40 for non-ASA members
